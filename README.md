# Known issues

* Some application icons keep jumping out of their folders into the home screens.
  This includes:
  * Contacts
  * Google Drive
  * Google Keep
* Multipoint Bluetooth seems to be problematic, at least when headphones are also connected to an Avantree DG80.

## Apps

### Firefox

* Tabs list needs a swipe up to be usable, because it does not fit in the square screen well.

### Lichess

* Interface layout does not cope well with square screen.

# Tricks

* Use https://github.com/alexpdp7/plankalkul/ as a calculator.
* USB Audio works, so you can use wireless USB audio headsets.
  Those didn't work in my previous Samsung A02s.
  Wireless USB audio headset often work better than Bluetooth headsets.

# Ideas

* Remap back or square buttons to get a magic key.
* Different fn remapping in different apps (e.g. tab and ctrl only on Termux)
* Research a better launcher
  * Find a better way to organize apps on home screen.
    I dump apps I rarely open in two folders (personal and work), but it does not work great.
* Find a way to create keyboard shortcuts in Firefox (close tab, go to URL bar, switch tabs).
* Research better software keyboards to use
  * Swiftkey (apparently has good physical keyboard support)
  * BlackBerry Keyboard
