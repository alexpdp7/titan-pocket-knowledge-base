# Known issues

  This includes:
  * Contacts
  * Google Drive
  * Google Keep
* Multipoint Bluetooth seems to be problematic, at least when headphones are also connected to an Avantree DG80.

## Apps

### Firefox

* Tabs list needs a swipe up to be usable, because it does not fit in the square screen well.

### Lichess

* Interface layout does not cope well with square screen.

# Tricks

* Long press on home, settings, uncheck menu mode switch.
  This enables the app drawer, so you don't need all apps on home.
* Use https://github.com/alexpdp7/plankalkul/ as a calculator.
* USB Audio works, so you can use wireless USB audio headsets.
  Those didn't work in my previous Samsung A02s.
  Wireless USB audio headset often work better than Bluetooth headsets.

# Ideas

* Find a way to make the keyboard backlight turn on before typing
  * Hitting any key, like shift, fn, or alt works.
    However, IIRC on BlackBerries touching the keyboard enabled the backlight?

  * Remap back or square buttons to get a magic key.

    * Find a better way to organize apps on home screen.
