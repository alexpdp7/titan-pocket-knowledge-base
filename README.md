# Known issues

## Apps

* Tabs list needs a swipe up to be usable, because it does not fit in the square screen well.

### Lichess

* Interface layout does not cope well with square screen.

# Tricks

* Use https://github.com/alexpdp7/plankalkul/ as a calculator.
* USB Audio works, so you can use wireless USB audio headsets.
  Those didn't work in my previous Samsung A02s.
  Wireless USB audio headset often work better than Bluetooth headsets.
* Network settings includes an option to show bandwidth usage on the status bar.

# Launchers

## Default launcher

* Long press on home, settings, uncheck menu mode switch.
  This enables the app drawer, so you don't need all apps on home.
  * This prevents an issue where some apps like Contacts, Google Drive, and Google Keep jump out of their folders to the homescreen.

# Remote control

* The built-in application can be accidentally uninstalled.
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiqiaa.remote seems to be the same app, although Play Store notes it has ads and in-app purchases

# Ideas

* Find a way to make the keyboard backlight turn on before typing
  * Hitting any key, like shift, fn, or alt works.
    However, IIRC on BlackBerries touching the keyboard enabled the backlight?
* Keyboard
  * Remap back or square buttons to get a magic key.
    * Or https://www.reddit.com/r/unihertztitanpocket/comments/qkc7md/where_is_the_search_key/
